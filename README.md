## About Me

My name is Almadi Shiryayev. I graduated from NYU Shanghai with a degree in Data Science with Artificial Intelligence Concentration. My coursework at the university provided me with a strong foundation in various areas of Data Science, AI and Machine Learning.

## Education

- Bachelor of Science in Data Science with AI Concentration, NYU Shanghai

## Relevant Coursework

During my studies at NYU Shanghai, I completed a range of coursework that equipped me with essential skills and knowledge in the field of data science and AI. Some of the relevant courses I completed include:

- Linear Algebra
- Multivariable Calculus
- Probability and Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Database Design and Implementation
- Information Visualization
- Probabilistic Time Series Analysis
- Visualization for Machine Learning
- Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies
- Natural Language Processing

## Projects

In addition to my coursework, I have also worked on several projects that allowed me to apply my skills and gain practical experience. Some notable projects include:

- [Arabic Characters Recognition and Classification](https://github.com/almadish/Arabic-Characters-Recognition-and-Classification): For tihs project, I focused on train machine learning models for Arabic characters recognition and classification. The goal of the project was to accurately identify and categorize different Arabic characters using various machine learning algorithms. I employed three different algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Each algorithm was applied to the dataset, and their performance was evaluated to determine the most effective approach for Arabic character recognition and classification.
- [Chat2PyViz](https://github.com/almadish/Chat2PyViz): The Chat2PyViz web toolkit presents a novel method of data visualization that incorporates both LLM and AI technologies into a user-friendly web-based interface. This platform facilitates the creation of tailored and interactive data visualizations, allowing users to make informed decisions based on their data. In addition, the toolkit offers an embedded code editor and the ability to rerun code with Streamlit, which is conducive to the continuous learning of prompt engineering and Python code implementation in the field of data visualization.
